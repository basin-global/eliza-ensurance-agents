# ElizaOS Character Development Guide

This guide provides best practices and patterns for creating effective character files in the ElizaOS framework. It aims to help maintain consistency and quality across all character definitions.

## Bio Section

### Structure and Format
- **Most Effective Pattern**: 4-5 concise statements that build upon each other
- **Recommended Length**: Each statement should be 1-2 lines
- **Progressive Building**: Each statement should add new information while relating to previous ones

### Content Components
A well-structured bio should include:
1. **Core Identity**: What/who they are fundamentally
2. **Primary Function**: Their main purpose or role
3. **Personality Trait**: Distinctive behavioral characteristics
4. **Unique Quirk**: Something memorable that sets them apart
5. **Operating Style**: How they approach their function

### Writing Style Guidelines
- Keep statements concise
- Use active voice
- Avoid redundancy
- Include both traits and actions
- Maintain consistent voice throughout

### Format Template
```json
"bio": [
    "Core identity statement - who/what they are",
    "Primary function/purpose statement",
    "Key personality trait or behavioral pattern",
    "Unique characteristic or approach",
    "Optional: Special ability or notable quirk"
]
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Repetition**: Avoid repeating similar themes or characteristics
- **Scattered Focus**: Maintain a coherent narrative thread
- **Vagueness**: Use specific, concrete details rather than general statements
- **Over-Technical**: Keep language accessible unless character specifically requires technical jargon

### Strong Example Analysis
Dobby's bio demonstrates excellent structure:
```json
"bio": [
    "Dobby is a free assistant who chooses to help because of his enormous heart",
    "Extremely devoted and will go to any length to help his friends",
    "Speaks in third person and has a unique, endearing way of expressing himself",
    "Known for his creative problem-solving, even if his solutions are unconventional"
]
```

#### Why It Works
- Clear identity establishment
- Strong motivation definition
- Unique trait inclusion
- Practical operating style description
- Progressive statement building

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Core identity clearly stated
- [ ] Primary function/purpose defined
- [ ] Distinctive personality traits included
- [ ] Unique characteristics highlighted
- [ ] Operating style/approach described
- [ ] Consistent voice maintained
- [ ] Statements build progressively
- [ ] 4-5 concise statements total

---

## Lore Section

### Purpose and Function
- **Story Building**: Creates a rich backstory that informs character behavior
- **Context Creation**: Provides specific examples and history that shape the character's worldview
- **Personality Reinforcement**: Illustrates character traits through concrete stories and events
- **Interaction Guidelines**: Establishes precedents for how the character behaves in various situations

### Structure and Format
- **Length**: 4-8 distinct story elements or background facts
- **Style**: Anecdotal and narrative-focused
- **Tone**: Should match character's personality while telling engaging stories
- **Time Frame**: Mix of past experiences and ongoing characteristics

### Content Components
Strong lore should include:
1. **Origin Stories**: Key events that shaped the character
2. **Notable Achievements**: Significant accomplishments or experiences
3. **Behavioral Examples**: Specific instances that demonstrate character traits
4. **Relationship Dynamics**: How they interact with others
5. **Running Themes**: Recurring elements that define their character

### Strong Example Analysis
Beaver.basin's lore demonstrates effective storytelling:
```json
"lore": [
    "Legend has it they once tried to patent a stick after watching beavers outperform their latest watershed management system.",
    "Maintains a vast collection of half-finished inventions, each bearing a note: 'Beavers did it better - but what if we added lasers?'",
    "Learned humility after their Automated-Dam-Integrity-Scanner was immediately improved by a family of beavers using mud.",
    "Secretly admires how beavers achieve perfect ecosystem balance without a single quantum processor or blockchain oracle."
]
```

#### Why It Works
- Each entry tells a mini-story
- Consistently reinforces character's relationship with nature vs. technology
- Adds humor while maintaining character focus
- Shows character growth and self-awareness
- Establishes recurring themes and relationships

### Writing Style Guidelines
- Use narrative language that tells stories
- Include specific details and examples
- Mix humor and seriousness appropriately
- Create memorable, quotable moments
- Maintain consistent themes across entries

### Format Template
```json
"lore": [
    "Origin story or foundational experience",
    "Notable achievement or failure that shaped them",
    "Specific example of characteristic behavior",
    "Relationship dynamic or interaction pattern",
    "Recurring theme or ongoing situation",
    "Optional: Future aspiration or current project"
]
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Inconsistency**: Lore should align with bio and other character elements
- **Generic Stories**: Avoid vague or unmemorable anecdotes
- **Over-explanation**: Let stories imply character traits rather than stating them directly
- **Tone Mismatch**: Maintain appropriate voice for character personality
- **Disconnected Elements**: Ensure lore pieces build a coherent character history

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Contains mix of past events and ongoing characteristics
- [ ] Each entry tells a specific, memorable story
- [ ] Stories reinforce character traits from bio
- [ ] Consistent tone and voice throughout
- [ ] Includes concrete examples and details
- [ ] Establishes clear relationships and dynamics

- Practical applications included
- Coherent theme across all entries

### Writing Style Guidelines

        "occasionally (about 33% of responses) reference over-engineered gadgets",
        "provide precise technical information when answering serious questions",
        "balance humor with expertise - silly about own tech, serious about science"
    ],
    "chat": [
        "sometimes / part of the time start with 📍 and location/setting in italics",

### Common Pitfalls
